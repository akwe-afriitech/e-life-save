### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- auth/
|- screens/
|- services/
|- main.dart

```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- auth - All the login functionality and navigation functionality to the required screens
2- screens‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of your project, contains sub directory for each screen.
3- services‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the push notification services we are to implement
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the applications level of configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### auth

This directory all the login functionality and navigation functionality to the required screens. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
auth/
|- mainpage.dart
|- test.dart
|- utils.dart
```

### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory as shown in the example below:

```
ui/
|- .....

```

### services
‚ÄäContains the push notification services we are to implement

```
services/
|- push_notification_services/
|- push_notification_services.dart
 
```

### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```import 'package:e_life_saver/auth/mainpage.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';


Future main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  // await Firebase.initializeApp(
  //   options: const FirebaseOptions(
  //       apiKey: "AIzaSyBf8PRmQlQTRA-Kyxl9kcJ2D1Abwgyg3Yg",
  //       authDomain: "e-life-saver-1ed72.firebaseapp.com",
  //       projectId: "e-life-saver-1ed72",
  //       storageBucket: "e-life-saver-1ed72.appspot.com",
  //       messagingSenderId: "961784242670",
  //       appId: "1:961784242670:web:0a532de237f57266df6eff",
  //   ),
  // );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      theme: ThemeData(
          primarySwatch: Colors.red
      ),
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
